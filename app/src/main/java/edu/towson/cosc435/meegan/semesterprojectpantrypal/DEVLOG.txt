4/2:
Having skipping frames error, but apparently if its less than 100 its not that big of a
deal, I reviewed my code and most of it is static and no calls are be made or being blocked atm.
Apparently sometimes the emulator will just be slow.

Error: I/Choreographer: Skipped 47 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
